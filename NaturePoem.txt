One heavy day I ran away from the grim face of society and the dizzying clamor of the city
 and directed my weary step to the spacious alley. I pursued the beckoning course of the 
rivulet and the musical sounds of the birds until I reached a lonely spot where the flowing
 branches of the trees prevented the sun from the touching the earth.

I stood there, and it was entertaining to my soul - my thirsty soul who had 
seen naught but the mirage of life instead of its sweetness.
